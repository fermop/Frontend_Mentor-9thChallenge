### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/) - This helps me to know where exactly I'm working on so I don't have to create classes with some weird names haha.
- [Josh Comeauâ€™s CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This reset makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need to be reset.
- [HTML Minifier](https://codebeautify.org/minify-html) - This page helps to have all your html document written in a single line.
- [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.org/) - This page helps to have all your css document written in a single line.

## Acknowledgments

I have to say thank you to [CodingTube's](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingTube), whithout you this design wouldn't be possible. I didn't know how to position the circles from the background and the way you did it with `background-position:` was perfect. I really really owe you one!
